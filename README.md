## üèóÔ∏è Set up
On windows you can just install the [Executable version](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/releases/latest), skip the entire set up section & go to [Quick Start](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader#-quick-start)

#### Python Version Requirements
If your operating system is not compatible with **executable versions** of Fansly Downloader (only Windows supported for ``.exe``) or you just generally intend to use the Python source directly, please [download the repository](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), extract the files from the folder and ensure that [Python is installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system. Once Python is installed, you can proceed by installing the following requirements using [Python's package manager](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/) (``"pip"``), within your systems terminal copy & paste:

	pip3 install requests loguru python-dateutil plyvel-ci psutil imagehash m3u8 av pillow rich pyexiv2 mutagen
Alternatively you can use [``requirements.txt``](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/blob/master/requirements.txt) through opening your system's terminal (e.g.: ``cmd.exe`` on windows), [navigating to the project's download folder](https://youtu.be/8-mYKkNzjU4?t=5) and executing the following command: ``pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt``

For Linux operating systems, you may need to install the Python Tkinter module separately by using the command ``sudo apt-get install python3-tk``. On Windows and macOS, the Tkinter module is typically included in the [Python installer itself](https://youtu.be/O2PzLeiBEuE?t=38).

After all requirements are installed into your python environment; click on *fansly_downloader.py* and it'll open up & [behave similar](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader#-quick-start) to how the executable version would.

Raw python code versions of Fansly Downloader do not receive automatic updates. If an update is available, you will be notified, but will need to manually [download the repository](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) as zip again, extract files and set-up the latest version of fansly downloader yourself.

## üöÄ Quick Start
To quickly get started with either the [python](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader#python-version-requirements) or the [executable](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/releases/latest) version of Fansly Downloader, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of Fansly Downloader by choosing one of the options below:
   - [Windows exclusive executable version](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/releases/latest) - "*Fansly Downloader.exe*"
   - [Python code version](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader#python-version-requirements) - "*fansly_downloader.py*"

   and extract the files from the zip folder.

2. Ensure that you have recently logged into your Fansly account and accessed the Fansly website using one of the following web browsers: **Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, or Opera GX** on the operating systems **Windows 10/11, macOS or Linux**.

3. Open and run the ``Fansly_Downloader`` file by clicking on it. This action will initiate the initial interactive setup tutorial for a configuration file called [``config.ini``](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/wiki/Explanation-of-provided-programs-&-their-functionality#explanation-of-configini).

4. After values for the targeted creators [Username](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/blob/fc7c6734061f6b61ddf3ef3ae29618aedc21e052/config.ini#L2), your fansly accounts [Authorization Token](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/blob/fc7c6734061f6b61ddf3ef3ae29618aedc21e052/config.ini#L5) and your web browsers [User-Agent](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/blob/fc7c6734061f6b61ddf3ef3ae29618aedc21e052/config.ini#L6) within the configuration file are acquired & populated through; either in the previous step mentioned interactive set-up help provided after the first ever launch of the program ``Fansly_Downloader`` itself, or with the use of the [manual set-up tutorial](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/wiki/Get-Started), you're good to go üéâ

Once you have completed the initial configuration of Fansly Downloader, for every future use case, you will only need to manually modify and save the creator's name for the "Targeted Creator > Username" section in the "config.ini" file using a text editor of your choice. Additional settings can also be found in the "config.ini" file, which are documented on [the Wiki](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/wiki/Explanation-of-provided-programs-&-their-functionality#4-configini) page.

## ü§î FAQ
Do you have any unanswered questions or want to know more about Fansly Downloader? Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/wiki) or check if your topic was mentioned in [Discussions](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/discussions) or [Issues](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/issues)

+ **Q**: "Is Fansly Downloader exclusive to Windows?"
**A**: No, Fansly Downloader can be ran on Windows, MacOS or Linux. It's just that the executable version of the downloader, is currently only being distributed for the windows 10 & 11 operating systems. You can use Fansly Downloader through the [raw python source](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader#%EF%B8%8F-set-up) on any other operating system and it'll behave the exact same as the Windows executable version.

+ **Q**: "Is it possible to download Fansly files on a mobile device?"
**A**: Unfortunately, downloading Fansly files on a mobile device is currently not supported by Fansly Downloader, or any other available means.

+ **Q**: "Why do some executables show detections on them in VirusTotal?"
**A**: The Fansly Downloader executables are not [digitally signature signed](https://www.digicert.com/signing/code-signing-certificates), as it comes with continous prohibitively expensive costs. So the executables tend to produce alot of false positives (invalid detections). Instead each release of the scraper is e-mailed to antivirus providers for manual analysis, and the not üí© providers actually analyse and unflag them, while others don't even bother reading their e-mails, but for some reason managed to get on VirusTotals file scanning system. If you're knowledgeable with the python programming language; any [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) compiled python executable, such as Fansly Downloader, is de-compileable with e.g. [uncompyle6](https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6/), so you could additionally assure yourself that no harmful code is being distributed to your local machine.

+ **Q**: "Could you add X feature or do X change?"
**A**: Star the project and I'll think about it. Otherwise you could always [open a pull request](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/pulls)

+ **Q**: "Will you add any payment bypassing features to Fansly Downloader?"
**A**: No, as the intention of this repository is not to harm fansly or its content creators

+ **Q**: "Is there a possibility of being banned?"
**A**: While there are no guarantees, it's worth noting that among the 24.000+ previous users, there have been no reported incidents.

If you still need help with something open up a [New Discussion](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/discussions/new/choose), instead of a issue ticket, as that is super annoying and it'll only get you banned from interacting entirely with the repository. Issue tickets are reserved for reporting genuine or suspected bugs in the codebase of the Downloader, which require immediate attention from the maintainers.
